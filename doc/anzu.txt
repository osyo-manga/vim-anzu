Introduction					*anzu-introduction*

*anzu* is a plug-in for assisting the search position visually and easily.
Using |:sign| when searching t can display search position like (2/10) or
display the position in the sidebar like a search in a browser.

It basically remaps search command keys (|n|, |N|, etc.).

-Requires
 Vim version 7.3.867+


==============================================================================
Usage						*anzu-usage*

Example: >
	" Use it instead of n or N.
	nmap n <Plug>(anzu-n)
	nmap N <Plug>(anzu-N)
	nmap * <Plug>(anzu-star)
	nmap # <Plug>(anzu-sharp)

	" If you want to output search status information with g*
	nmap g* g*<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status-with-echo)

	" Move to the [count] occurrence of the last searched word.
	" 10<Leader>j move to the position of the tenth occurrence from
	" the beginning
	nmap <Leader>j <Plug>(anzu-jump)
	" Output search status information to the command line
	" nmap <Leader>j <Plug>(anzu-jump)<Plug>(anzu-echo-search-status)

	" Display search status information to statusline
	set statusline=%{anzu#search_status()}

	" After the move, the search status information is output to
	" the command line.
	" nmap n <Plug>(anzu-n-with-echo)
	" nmap N <Plug>(anzu-N-with-echo)
	" nmap * <Plug>(anzu-star-with-echo)
	" nmap # <Plug>(anzu-sharp-with-echo)

	" Using together with sign
	" nmap n <Plug>(anzu-n-with-echo)<Plug>(anzu-sign-matchline)
	" nmap N <Plug>(anzu-N-with-echo)<Plug>(anzu-sign-matchline)


==============================================================================
anzu-mode					*anzu-mode*

|anzu-mode| is the mode to display the number of occurrences next to the word
you searched for.
For example, if you search with /anzu,
>
	anzu(1/2)_homu
	anzu(2/2)_mami
<
The number of occurrences is displayed next to the word searched in the
buffer.

To start this mode, you need to call the following function or mapping.
 >
	" To start anzu-mode:
	" after searching with "anzu", move with n
	" it will be anzu-mode
	call anzu#mode#start("anzu", "n", "", "")

	" Start anzu-mode after n
	nmap n <Plug>(anzu-mode-n)
	" Start anzu-mode after N
	nmap N <Plug>(anzu-mode-N)
<
|anzu-mode| accepts only the |n| or |N| keys.
If any other key is pressed, |anzu-mode| will exit.


==============================================================================
Interface					*anzu-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands					*anzu-commands*

:AnzuClearSearchStatus				*:AnzuClearSearchStatus*
	Clear the search status information.

:AnzuUpdateSearchStatus				*:AnzuUpdateSearchStatus*
	Update the search status information at the current cursor position.
	The information is updated only when the cursor position matches
	the search position.

	Also, since this command does not output search status information
	use it in combination with |anzu#search_status()|.

	Example: >
		" Update each time the cursor moves
		augroup anzu-update-search-status
			autocmd!
			autocmd CursorMoved *
			\ :AnzuUpdateSearchStatus|echo anzu#search_status()
		augroup END
	<

:AnzuSignMatchLine[!] [{pattern}]			*:AnzuSignMatchLine*
	The line that matches the {pattern} in the buffer is |:sign| relative
	to the position in the buffer.
	(The search position is displayed in the sidebar like when searching
	with tools such as browsers)

	If [!] is used, |anzu#sign_matchline| is called, otherwise
	|anzu#smart_sign_matchline| is used.
	If you want to force |:sign| use [!].

	Be aware that using |:sign| not by |anzu| may overwrite existing signs.
	If there is no {pattern}, the value of |@/| is used.

:AnzuClearSignMatchLine [{pattern}]		*:AnzuClearSignMatchLine*
	Delete |:sign| was set by |anzu|.
	Be aware that |:sign| which was set by something other than |anzu| may
	also be deleted.
	Also, if you use |:sign-unplace| to delete |:sign|,
	|:AnzuSignMatchLine| may not work properly.
	In that case, call this command and also |:AnzuSignMatchLine|.

:AnzuClearSearchCache				*:AnzuClearSearchCache*
	Clear the cache of the search information of the current buffer.

:AnzuUpdateSearchStatusOutput			*AnzuUpdateSearchStatusOutput*
	After |:AnzuUpdateSearchStatus| an |anzu#search_status()| will output
	with |:echo|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions					*anzu-functions*

anzu#search_status()				*anzu#search_status()*
	Returns the current search status information as a string.

anzu#clear_search_status()			*anzu#clear_search_status()*
	Clear the search status information.

anzu#echohl_search_status()			*anzu#echohl_search_status()*
	Highlight the status information with |:echohl| and output it.
	The highlight group is set via |g:anzu_status_format|.

anzu#sign_matchline({pattern})			*anzu#sign_matchline()*
	|:sign| the position of {pattern}.

anzu#smart_sign_matchline({pattern})		*anzu#smart_sign_matchline()*
	|:sign| the position of {pattern}.
	Basically it works the same as |anzu#sign_matchline|, but it is designed
	not to waste |:sign| as much as possible.
	(e.g. not |:sign| when the cursor does not go outside the window)

	However, beware that |:sign| may not be set properly in some cases.
	(e.g. when using |:sign-unplace| instead of |AnzuClearSignMatchLine|
	to delete |:sign|)

anzu#clear_sign_matchline()			*anzu#clear_sign_matchline()*
	|:sign| delete.

anzu#clear_search_cache([{bufnr}])		*anzu#clear_search_cache()*
	Clear cache of search data of buffer number {bufnr}
	This is called by |TextChanged| and |TextChangedI|.

						*anzu#mode#start()*
anzu#mode#start({pattern}, {key}, {prefix}, {suffix})
	Start search with {pattern} in |anzu-mode|.
	The key {key} is called first.
	{prefix} and {suffix} are added as prefix and suffix respectively
	when |n| and |N|are pressed with |anzu-mode|.
Example: >
	" Search anzu, move with n and enter anzu-mode
	" when n or N is pressed in anzu-mode
	" it is processed as nzzzv or Nzzzv
	call anzu#mode#start("anzu", "n", "", "zzzv")
<

anzu#mode#mapexpr({key}, {prefix}, {suffix})	*anzu#mode#mapexpr()*
	The behavior is the same as |anzu#mode#start()|, except using
	|:map-<expr>|. |@/| is used for {pattern}.
Example: >
	" Processing as nzzzv when n is pressed in anzu-mode
	nnoremap <expr> n anzu#mode#mapexpr("n", "", "zzzv")
	" Processing as Nzzzv when N is pressed in anzu-mode
	nnoremap <expr> N anzu#mode#mapexpr("N", "", "zzzv")


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key mappings					*anzu-key-mappings*

<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status)		*<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status)*
	Update the search status information.
	Basically it is used in combination with |n| and |N|.
	This mapping should be called after the move's mapping.

Example: >
	" Call after n or N.
	nmap n n<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status)
	nmap N N<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status)
<

<Plug>(anzu-clear-search-status)		*<Plug>(anzu-clear-search-status)*
	Clear the search status information.

<Plug>(anzu-clear-search-cache)			*<Plug>(anzu-clear-search-cache)*
	Clear the cache of the search information of the current buffer.

<Plug>(anzu-echo-search-status)			*<Plug>(anzu-echo-search-status)*
	Search status information is output to the command line.
	Note that search status information is not updated in this mapping.
	Use |<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status-with-echo)|
	when updating the search status information.

Example: >
	" Re-output the previous search status information
	nmap <A-p> <Plug>(anzu-update-search-status-with-echo)
<

<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status-with-echo)	*<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status-with-echo)*
	After updating the search status information, also output it to
	the command line.
	This mapping should be called after the move's mapping.

Example: >
	" Call after g*.
	nmap g* g*<Plug>(anzu-update-search-status-with-echo)
<

<Plug>(anzu-n)					*<Plug>(anzu-n)*
	Behavior similar to |n| except that |<Plug>(anzu-search-status-update)|
	is hooked.

<Plug>(anzu-n-with-echo)			*<Plug>(anzu-n-with-echo)*
	Like |<Plug>(anzu-n)|, but also the search status information
	will be output to the command line.

<Plug>(anzu-N)					*<Plug>(anzu-N)*
	Behavior similar to |N| except that |<Plug>(anzu-search-status-update)|
        is hooked.

<Plug>(anzu-N-with-echo)			*<Plug>(anzu-N-with-echo)*
	Like |<Plug>(anzu-N)|, but also the search status information
	will be output to the command line.

	|<Plug>(anzu-search-status-update)| is hooked.

<Plug>(anzu-star-with-echo)			*<Plug>(anzu-star-with-echo)*
	Like |<Plug>(anzu-star)|, but also the search status information
	will be output to the command line.

<Plug>(anzu-sharp)				*<Plug>(anzu-sharp)*
	Behavior similar to |#| except that |<Plug>(anzu-search-status-update)|
        is hooked.

<Plug>(anzu-sharp-with-echo)			*<Plug>(anzu-sharp-with-echo)*
	Like |<Plug>(anzu-sharp)|, but also the search status information
        will be output to the command line.

<Plug>(anzu-sign-matchline)			*<Plug>(anzu-sign-matchline)*
	|:AnzuSignMatchLine| with [!] is called.
	|@/| is used as the argument of |:AnzuSignMatchLine|.
	This mapping should be called after the move's mapping.

Example: >
	" Call after n or N.
	nmap n n<Plug>(anzu-sign-matchline)
	nmap N N<Plug>(anzu-sign-matchline)
<

	Call |:AnzuSignMatchLine| without [!].

<Plug>(anzu-jump)				*<Plug>(anzu-jump)*
	Move to the [count] position of the last searched word.
	If [count] does not exist or is out of range, it will not move.
Example: >
	" Move to the position of [count] occurrence of the last searched word
	" 10<Leader>j means move to the position of the tenth word from
	" the beginning
	nmap <Leader>j <Plug>(anzu-jump)

<

<Plug>(anzu-jump-n)				*<Plug>(anzu-jump-n)*
	Move to the [count] position of the last searched word.
	10<Plug>(anzu-jump-n) means move to the position of the tenth word
	from the beginning of the buffer.
	If there is no [count], use |<Plug>(anzu-n)| instead.
	If [count] is out of range, it will not move.
Example: >
	nmap n <Plug>(anzu-jump-n)

	" When you want to output the position to the command line
	nmap n <Plug>(anzu-jump-n)<Plug>(anzu-echo-search-status)
<
<Plug>(anzu-jump-N)				*<Plug>(anzu-jump-N)*

	is used when there is no [count].

<Plug>(anzu-jump-sharp)				*<Plug>(anzu-jump-sharp)*
	It is the same as |<Plug>(anzu-jump-sharp)| except that
	|<Plug>(anzu-sharp)| is used when there is no [count].
